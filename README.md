Tech Stack

ReflectYr uses a modern web stack, making it lightweight, scalable, and easy to deploy:
‚Ä¢ Next.js: React framework with App Router and server-side rendering.
‚Ä¢ TailwindCSS: Utility-first styling for a fast, responsive UI.
‚Ä¢ Heroicons: Beautiful, reusable icons (e.g., clock, arrow-path).
‚Ä¢ Prisma: Database ORM for clean and efficient database management.

export default function Example() {
return ;
}
